Visualizations of data from my PV systems.

Currently, I just have scripts that clean up data exported from Green Mountain Power, and then peform basic visualizations and summaries.

My next step is to generalize the data pre-processor, so that the visualization script can can consume data from multiple data sources (e.g. I get data for my other system via [My SunPower](https://login.mysunpower.com/) )
